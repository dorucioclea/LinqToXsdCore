# LinqToXsd.Schemas

This project contains the code generated by the `LinqToXsd` tool for several existing schemas compiled into a single assembly and serves to support the `XObjectsTests` testing library. The original Microsoft-repository on Codeplex contained only simple integration tests. Most of the bugs in the code base are in the code-generation logic, so this library serves as a way to not only find bugs with the code generation logic but also keep track of changes to the generated code and see how bug fixes or updates to the logic changes code generation output. As this library must compile successfully for the `XObjectsTests` projbect to even run any tests, it also serves as a gate keeper, ensuring that any changes to the code generation must actually produce compilable code.
